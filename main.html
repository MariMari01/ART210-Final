        <i>The Black Woman</i> was strongly influenced by art of the Taller de Graficas Popular, a Mexican
        art group that Elizabeth Catlett was a part of. 
        Many of the member inside the Taller de Graficas Popular were communists and due to the red scare in 
        America Elizabeth Catlett would eventually end up exiled. From here she got natrualized as a Mexican 
        citizen and moved to Mexico. She would not be able to recover her American citizenship until 2002.

    <div class="text-container" id="rightSummary">
        The story telling through artwork titles truly elevates the series as a whole and is a great 
        example of the evolution that art was going through in the American Modernism scene. This series
        is a piece of story telling, a poem, and several prints all simultaneously at once.
